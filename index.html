<h3>Conclusion: The data seems to show that CPI tends to increase more when Republicans are in control of the White House<br>
which disproves my hypothesis.</h3>
<p>There are a lot of things to consider when looking at CPI as not all presidents enforce the same policies even within the same party.<br>
This is why I choose to show both president CPI term averages with a histogram and a blanket scatter plot of CPI percent increases year by year<br>
with color indicating party.</p>
<br>
<p>One problem I encountered was getting the data to scale properly to accurately represent changes in CPI<br>
for each year and presidential term.  Inflation is a hotly debated topic in todays political climate with a <br>
Democratic president so especially now, giving a fair view of historic CPI changes was important.</p>
<br>
<p>In class we learned the importance of making graphs easy to understand and knowing who the target audience is.<br>
I definetely want my target audience to be the common everyday citizen so I thought it was important it was simple to understand <br>
with no background information.  I think if I were to add more data it would be interesting to see the CPI changes <br>
along with what political parties controll the house and senate as obviously the president is not the end all for<br>
policy creation in the United States.</p>
